# Embedded Systems Project - Summer Semester 2018
Two autonomous robots are programmed to play a game against an opposing team. Each robot is equipped with a set of sensors and actuators, including modules for communication and movement.
Requirements included reading and interpreting sensor readings properly, abiding real-time constraints, coping with hardware interrupts, and complying with operating conditions of different modules.
At the end of the course, groups participated in an ungraded competition to showcase their results.
