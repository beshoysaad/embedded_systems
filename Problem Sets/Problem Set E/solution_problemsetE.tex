\section{Problem E1 : Testing}
	\begin{center}

\begin{itemize}
	\item [a] A statement path is a path where every reachable statement executed at least once. Hence the path with statement but not decision coverage is
\begin{center}
	\large\textbf{abcdeaghjkhi}
\end{center}
	\item [b] A simple path that is not a prime path is 
\begin{center}
		\large\textbf{abcd}
\end{center}
	\item [c] Set of prime paths in our graph is
	\begin{center}
		\large\textbf{abfe, abcde, hjk, feaghj, feaghi, cdeaghi, cdeaghj}
	\end{center}
	The minimal set of paths achieving prime path coverage are
	\begin{center}
		\large\textbf{abfeabcdeaghjkhi, feaghj, feaghi, cdeaghi}
	\end{center}
\item [d] Number of test paths
\subitem[i] Since the graph contains loops, it has infinite number of test paths
\subitem[ii] To get test paths achieving prime path coverage we take the original paths and make them start from the source and end up at the sink:
\begin{center}
	\large\textbf{abfeabcdeaghjkhi, abfeaghjkhi, abfeaghi, abcdeaghi}
\end{center}
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem E2: Coverage Hierarchy}
The following diagram shows the position of all-round-trip coverage criterion in the CFG Coverage Criteria hierarchy.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[height=2.9in]{E2}
\end{center}

The only predecessor of $M_{rt}$ is path coverage criterion, which is exhaustive of all paths and thus has higher coverage than $M_{rt}$. On the other hand, prime path coverage criterion, which is the only successor of $M_{rt}$, is concerned only with path coverage and doesn't traverse loops, so $M_{rt}$ has higher coverage than prime path coverage criterion.

\section{Problem E3: Linear Time Properties}

\begin{itemize}
	\item [a] Automaton
	
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[height=2.9in]{E3}
	\end{center}
	
	\item[b] Translate the following specifications to LTL
	\subitem[i] WALL·E’s battery never depletes
	$$G(\neg bdep )$$
	
	\subitem[ii] Whenever WALL·E leaves home, he will come back
	$$G(\neg home \rightarrow Fhome)$$
	
	\subitem[iii] WALL·E will never pick up more than two pieces of trash without compacting in-between
	$$G(pu2 \rightarrow X cing)$$
	
	\subitem[iv] WALL·E never leaves a plant behind
	$$GF(fis \rightarrow (X puf | XXX puf))$$
	
	\item [c] Safety properties: i, iii.
	
	Liveness properties: ii, iv.
	

\end{itemize}
